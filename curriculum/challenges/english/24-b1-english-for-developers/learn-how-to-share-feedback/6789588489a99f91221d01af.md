# --explanation--

The phrase `catch an issue` means to identify or detect a problem, often before it causes further complications. It is commonly used in contexts like QA, troubleshooting, or debugging. For example:

`The developer caught a major issue in the code before the deployment.` - Here, the developer detected a serious problem in the code. 

In this sentence, Bob is acknowledging Jessica’s ability to detect problems during her QA work, which contributed to the team’s success.
